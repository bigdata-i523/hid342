\section{Introduction}

National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) football is one of the most widely watched sports in the United States. The size of the fan base and the profits that can be derived from televised games incentivizes universities and other interested parties to invest in the application of big data analytics and data science methods in general to improve on-field outcomes by enabling better management of player well-being and performance. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the use of data science in National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) football. Recent research on the use of data science to improve various aspects of NCAA football will be surveyed, while current trends and their implications will be discussed.
